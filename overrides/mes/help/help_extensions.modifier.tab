TAG_BLACKGUARDS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Blackguards	The blackguard epitomizes evil. He is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains antipaladins due to their completely evil nature. The blackguard has many options available to him-sending forth dark minions and servants to do his bidding, attacking with stealth and honorless guile, or straightforward smiting of the forces of good that stand in his way. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, monks, druids, and barbarians make for indomitable combat-oriented blackguards, while rogues and bards who become blackguards are likely to stress the subtle aspects of their abilities and spells. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who become blackguards are sometimes called diabolists and favor dealing with fiends even more than other blackguards do.Hit Die: d10Requirements:To qualify to become a blackguard, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tAlignment: Any evil. @tBase Attack Bonus:+6.@tSkills: Hide 5 ranks@tFeats: Cleave, Power Attack. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BLACKGUARD].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields. Dark Blessing (Su): A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws. Spells: A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blackguard with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard's Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level blackguard), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard's spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflictspells).      ~Spell List~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BLACKGUARD_SPELLS]Smite Good (Su): Once a day, a blackguard of 2nd level or higher may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. For example, a 9th-level blackguard armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+9 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high Strength or magical effects that normally apply. If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and again at 10th level, a blackguard may smite good one additional time per day. Aura of Despair (Su):Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. Command Undead (Su): When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.Sneak Attack: This ability, gained at 4th level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage increases by +1d6 every third level beyond 4th (7th and 10th). If a blackguard gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.Fallen Paladins@tBlackguards who have levels in the paladin class (that is to say, are now ex-paladins) gain extra abilities the more levels of paladin they have.@tLevel 1+:   Smite good 1/day@tLevel 5+:    Sneak attack damage increased by +1d6. Smite good 2/day.@tLevel 9+:   Smite good 3/day@tThe rest of the Fallen Paladin bonuses are yet to be implemented.Fiendish Servant: like the Paladin's mount, this class feature is not implemented.
